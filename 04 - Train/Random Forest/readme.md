# Random Forest
Random Forest build on top of Decision Trees and Perturb and Combine Methods. While Decision Trees recursevely looks for optimal splits, P&C methods creates multiple methods on perturbed data sets (for instance resampled data) and then combine the predictions. Random Forest combine multiple Decision Trees ran against sampled data (both rows and columns).
