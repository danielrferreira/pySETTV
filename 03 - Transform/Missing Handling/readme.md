# Missing Handling
Handling missing data in predictive modeling is essential to prevent biased and inaccurate model outcomes. Ignoring missing values can lead to the loss of entire rows, reducing the dataset size and potentially excluding valuable information. Addressing missing data through proper imputation methods ensures a more complete and representative dataset, enhancing model generalizability and accuracy. 

This code will go through some of the most common methods to identify and input missings:
* Identify Missing
* Missing Exploration (Relationship between missingness and outcome)
* Missing Imputation:
  - Missing Label
  - Mean, Median, Mode
  - Distribution Based
  - Model Based
