# Overall Structure of the Data
The first step in an analysis (after gathering the data), is to look at the data. Some best practices includes answerings the following questions:
- What is the size of the file (if the data is in a file system)?
- How columns are delimited?
- First row contains columns names?
- How many rows and columns?
- What are the name of the columns?
- How the first rows look like?

This code provide very basic exploration of text files and pandas DataFrames.
