# Generalized Linear Models

Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) extend linear regression to handle non-normally distributed errors. While not as prominent in deep learning discussions, GLMs offer interpretability and statistical robustness. In the era of big data, the focus on test data metrics overshadowed discussions about parameter estimates and regression assumptions. However, GLMs excel in scenarios where interpretability and a strong statistical foundation are essential, finding applications in econometrics, biology, medicine, and finance. The following code demonstrates fitting GLMs and examining parameter estimates.
