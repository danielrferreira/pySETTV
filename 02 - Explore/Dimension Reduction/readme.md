# Dimension Reduction
[Curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) is real and using an adequate number of features is desired. We will cover two very used ideas:
- Feature selection and ranking: Finding the best features to use.
- Principal Component Analysis: Creating new features that summarize the original features.

Dimension Reduction techniques should be performed not only in the exploration phase. In this codes, I will provide just some basics ideas to have a first idea on what variables could impact the models. But, when fitting the model, we will revisit this discussion, since many techniques are linked to specific modeling techniques.
