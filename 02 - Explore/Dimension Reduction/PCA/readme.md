# Principal Component Analysis
Principal components are linear combinations of your original features. These linear combinations have maximum variance and, by selection the top PCs, you can capture majority of your data variability. The code aims to discuss the usage of PCA in exploration phase, so we will cover the following topics:
- Running PCA
- Plotting the amount of variance each component captured
- Visualizing the first 2 components with scatter plots
- Visualizing the first 3 components with 3D scatter plots.
