# pySTETV (WIP)
Codes to Sample, Transform, Explore, Train Models and Validate Models.

## Sample
- File Import
- Filter
- Simple random sample
- Stratified Sample
- Data Partition (Train, Validation, Test)
## Transform
- Merge and Append Tables
- Aggregate functions
- Filter
- Variable Recoding
- Variable Math transformation
- Missing handling
## Explore
* One Dimension:
  - Binary 
  - Nominal
  - Quantitative
  - Skewed Quantitative
* 2 dimensions, 1x1 Analysis:
  - Binary vs Categorical
  - Binary vs Quantitative
  - Categorical (low-cardinality) vs Quantitative
  - Categorical (high-cardinality) vs Quantitative
  - Quantitative vs Quantitative
* Unsupervised Learning:
  - Cluster
  - Self Organized Maps
* Dimension Reduction:
  - Principal Components
  - Factorial Analysis
* Feature Ranking
## Train Models
- Linear Regression
- Generalized Linear Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machine
## Validate Models
