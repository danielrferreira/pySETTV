# Linear Regression
For this code we will show sklear and scipy Normal Linear Regression methods. This code will cover the following topics:
* Simple Linear Regression using:
    - scipy
    - seaborn
    - statsmodel
    - sklearn
* Deep dive on sklearn results:
    - Fit Statistics: R squared, Adjusted R Squared, MSE and MAE
    - Residuals analysis: Residuals vs Inputs, Residuals vs Prediction, Normality of Errors  
* Multiple Linear Regression:
    - Fit / Predict / Coeffs / Fit Statistics / Residuals
    - Feature Selection: LASSO and Sequential
