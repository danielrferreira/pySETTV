# Classification Models Assessment
After running a model, the next natural question is around model performance. How good is your model? The answer to this questions will depend on the final purpouse of your model:
- Purely Classification: For this case, metrics like accuracy, recall and precision can help understand model quality.
- Probability Estimation: Sometimes the output of your model will be used as an input in another calculation. Average Squared Error can be more sensitive when you are trying to get as closer to 1 and 0.
- Ranking: For models that will be used to rank cases, KS and AUC can be used.
