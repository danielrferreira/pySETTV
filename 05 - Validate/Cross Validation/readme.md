# Cross Validation
In many cases our table is not big eneough to split into train and test (or validation). For this cases we can use cross validation. Cross-validation evaluate a model's performance by testing it on different parts of the data. The dataset is split into several parts (called "folds"), and the model is trained on some folds and tested on the remaining ones. This process is repeated multiple times, with each fold getting a turn as the test set. It helps ensure the model performs well on unseen data and avoids overfitting without the need of a separate dataset to validate the results.
