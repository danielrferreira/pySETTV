# Model Comparison - WIP
This section is a bit different from the earlier ones. I noticed a gap when moving from SAS Miner to R and Python, so I decided to create a class with some functions to compare models. It focuses on categorical outcomes but can be adapted for quantitative variables if needed.

The py file contains a class called problem and the notebook show how to import and use it.
