# Regression Tree
Regression trees are a type of decision tree designed for continuous outcome variables,it model continuous outcomes by dividing data into subsets based on feature values. They split the data to minimize variance in each subset, leading to a tree where each leaf predicts the outcome's mean or median for observations in that segment. This approach is straightforward and interpretable, capturing non-linear relationships effectively, though it can overfit without careful pruning.

Many options are the same as Decision Tree, so this code is shorter than most codes.
