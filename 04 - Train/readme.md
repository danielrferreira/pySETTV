# Train Model
This section covers some of the most common modeling techniques. I didn’t delve deeply into neural networks, as they are not my primary area of expertise. Additionally, this repository does not address time series analysis.

I’ve included a feature-ranking application in the Random Forest code, which I found particularly useful for exploratory analysis.
