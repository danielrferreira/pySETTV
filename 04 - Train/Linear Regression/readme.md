# Linear Regression
For this code we will show sklear and scipy Normal Linear Regression methods. I will show how to:
* Fit
* Predict
* Analyze coeficients
* Calculate Fit Statistics:
  - R squared (and Adjusted R Squared)
  - MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE
* Residuals analysis:
  - Residuals vs Inputs
  - Residuals vs Prediction
  - Normality of Errors
