# K-Nearest Neighbors 
One of the laziest classification algorithms is called KNN. KNN calculates the distance (similarity) between each observation and classify using simple voting. If the k nearest neighbors are in majority from class A (if not binary they will use the mode), the obsevation will be classified as A.
