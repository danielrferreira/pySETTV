# Binary Outcome vs All types of Inputs
When we have Binary Outcomes, we want to understad how the proportion of positive cases changes for different ranges and values of inputs. 

For categorical inputs, this folder contains one master function, but also codes for specific cases (like high cardinality nominal inputs). 

For quantitative inputs, we will explore distribution of inputs across negative and positive outcomes but also add one code to better understand if there is linear relationship between x and log(p/(1-p)).
