# Generalized Linear Models
GLM extend the linear regression applications to other cases where the error doesn't follow a normal distribution. 
Machine Learning books and texts don't usually talks about GLM. With big data and computational power,  the discussion around parameter estimates and regression assumptions got eclipsed by test data performance metrics. This code will show how to run a GLM but is not going far.
