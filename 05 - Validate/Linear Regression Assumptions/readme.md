# Linear Regression Assumptions Check
When conducting Linear Regression analysis, certain assumptions must be met. If your primary objective is purely predictive accuracy, these assumptions may not significantly impact your results, though they can provide insight into why the model might underperform. However, if you rely on p-values to inform business decisions, failing to validate these assumptions can lead to inaccurate or invalid conclusions. This code will help checking the following assumptions:
- Homocedasticity
- Normality of Residuals
- Error Independence
- Linearity
