# Random Forest
Random Forest build on top of Decision Trees and Perturb and Combine Methods. While Decision Trees recursevely looks for optimal splits, P&C methods creates multiple methods on perturbed data sets (for instance resampled data) and then combine the predictions. Random Forest can be used to create predictions when there is no need for simple rules interpretation.
