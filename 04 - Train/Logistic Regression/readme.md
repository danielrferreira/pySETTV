# Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression uses a link function to confine outcome estimates within the range of 0 and 1. Its interpretability has elevated its status, particularly in highly regulated industries. Additionally, Logistic Regression showcases flexibility by accommodating interactions, polynomial terms, and transformations to model complex relationships. The provided code covers essential aspects of Logistic Regression using sklearn:
- Fitting a Logistic Regression model
- Fine-tuning optimization parameters (solver, max iteration)
- Incorporating polynomial and interaction effects
- Conducting feature selection
- Analyzing basic fit statistics.
