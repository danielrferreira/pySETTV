# Artifficial Neural Networks
ANN is a huge part of ML and, since it first architetures, it evolved to deep learning algorithms that power most of our day to day AI systems. This code will focus on classic architettures, such as Multi-layer Perceptron. I will also cover some basic ideas on the topic.
