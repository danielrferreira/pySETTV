# Cluster Analysis
Cluster Analysis can be helpful when you have quantitative columns and you want to understand how observations naturally group. This code will use k-means algorithms to group observation together. The provided code cover the following topics:
- Exploration of inputs: Correlation and kernel distribution plots
- Standartization: MinMax and StandardScaler
- Finding optimal k: Running k-means with limitations on n_init and max_iter. PCA analysis to better understand rank of the matrix.
- Understanding results: PCA 2-D plot, Pie chart, violin plots.
