# Generalized Linear Models
GLM extend the linear regression applications to other cases where the error doesn't follow a normal distribution. GLM is not prominently discussed in the context of certain deep learning applications or cutting-edge research because they belong to a more traditional set of statistical modeling techniques.

With big data and computational power,  the discussion around parameter estimates probability distributions and regression assumptions got eclipsed by test data performance metrics. Although, GLM still good in situations where interpretability, simplicity, and a solid statistical foundation are important. They are widely used in fields such as econometrics, biology, medicine, and finance, where understanding the relationships between variables is crucial.

The code is going to show how to fit and see parameter estimates.
