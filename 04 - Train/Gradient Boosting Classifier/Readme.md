# Gradient Boosting for Classification
Gradient Boosting is also an Ensemble method (like random forests) that uses multiple models to make a prediction. 
The difference is that GB use sequential models, instead of running multiple models in parallel mode. It works by iteratively training new models to address the shortcomings of previous models, gradually improving overall performance.
