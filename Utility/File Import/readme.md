# File Import (input file -> pandas DataFrame)

90% of time a simple pandas [read_csv](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) will do the trick, but I also added two options:
1) Function that import 5 different types of files without having to mention with type you are trying to import into a data
2) Import csv from scratch if you want to dig and try something different
